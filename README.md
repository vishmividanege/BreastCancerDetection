# Breast Cancer Detection using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This project implements a **Breast Cancer Detection system** using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built with Python and TensorFlow. The system can predict whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant** based on patient features, and it also supports **batch predictions via CSV files**.

## Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve survival rates. This project uses machine learning to classify tumors as **benign** or **malignant** based on patient data using an ANN model.

---

## Features
- Predict tumor type for a single patient.
- Upload CSV files for batch predictions.
- Feature scaling for better model performance.
- Interactive visualization of dataset features.
- High model accuracy with precision and recall metrics.

---

## Dataset
- The model uses the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`.
- Features include measurements like `mean radius`, `mean texture`, `mean perimeter`, `mean area`, and more.
- Target labels: `0 = Malignant`, `1 = Benign`.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- scikit-learn
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Joblib
- Streamlit (optional for web app interface)
